# Learn To Web Dev

Well....not yet.

A friend of mine who wanted to start learning the basics of html and css asked my why they cannot write the code on their tablet.

There are a lot of great tools for this already. But I thought it sounded fun to build my own little html playground.

There is still a lot of work to do, I would like to add lessons to guide students one by one through all the important concepts and my end goal it is for it to be a resource for kids to get a feel for writing code and learning html. But for now as a playground it works pretty well.
